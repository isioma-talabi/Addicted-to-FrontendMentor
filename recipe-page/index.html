    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Beat the eggs: </b>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
      </li>
      <li><b>Heat the pan: </b>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the omelette: </b>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
        the eggs evenly coat the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
      </li>
